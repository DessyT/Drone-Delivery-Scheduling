Is it ok if my aims have changed from the project proposal?

The results - My Aim in the project proposal was "to build a drone delivery shceduler" Should my poster have the different results of search algorithms?

Methods - Outlining the different algorithms?

Acknowledgements and References - Are these general or specific to the poster

Produce my own graphs comparing delivery times of the algorithms?
Graph ideas - Total route time GA vs GFS. Total route time for different max drone flight times. Average route time. Route length vs time - Does a certain algorithm find longer routes that are quicker to complete? Time taken to find routes.
