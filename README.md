# Drone-Delivery-Scheduling
Honours project to schedule drone delivery

A GUI developed using PyQt allows input of sample customer locations, drone parameters and search and clustering algorithms.

1 - first set up an account with darksky API at - https://darksky.net/dev

2 - Create a file "config.py" in the root directory and add the line "api_key = "APIKEY"

3 - Run qtGUI with python3. Aberdeen.sqlite3 is a sample db.

Locked down to only having an Aberdeen depot for the moment, this will be revised in future versions.
