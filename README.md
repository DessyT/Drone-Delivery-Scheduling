# Drone-Delivery-Scheduling
Honours project to schedule drone delivery

A GUI developed using PyQt allows input of sample customer locations, drone parameters and search and clustering algorithms.

To use, run qtGUI with python3. Aberdeen.sqlite3 is a sample db.

Locked down to Aberdeen only for the moment, this will be revised in future versions.
