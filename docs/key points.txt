I'm assuming that drone tech will evolve to the point of carrying multiple packages - traditional TSP without the use of roads. 
TSP has been solved before - include drone parameters - maximum travel distance, maximum number of packages etc.
Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem
Point of my software to provide user with a choice of which algorithm to use? Determine which will be best for cost, speed, best for customers, best for business?

Provide a solution that:
Solution that looks to the future. Current limitations and how good it can be. What is likely to exist soon.
Shows current drone tech capabilities, ability for user to increase drone capability of battery life and maximum weight it can carry.
Allow user to select what they want the solution optimised for. Speed? Cost?

For Lit review:

Drone Delivery
   - What is it
   - Why is it important
   - What's been done
   - Where can I improve

   - Drone + Van seems to be current solution due to limitations of drones. Improving drone tech = my solution wins
	Improvements = battery life + carry weight
   - Prove drone tech improvement will enable TSP as a solution

Scheduling Algorithms
What are they
Examples - pros and cons
When do we need complete and optimal? Or is time to find route more important? How long to calculate perfect route?
   - Travelling Salesperson
	P = NP
   - Local Search
   - A*
   - Genetic Algorithm

How to find if its working
   - Does it improve on other methods
   - Limitations
   - Issues


For 21/10
Worth explaining p = np, np-hard etc?
How in depth to go with search types
papers/websites?

Completely ignore drone limitations? Instead just allow users to see the effect of adding drones to network on speed?
